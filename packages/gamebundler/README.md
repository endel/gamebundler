# ðŸ“¦ Game Bundler ðŸ•¹

_Zero_-configuration JavaScript Game Bundler.

## Goals:

- Turn JavaScript/TypeScript **code** into playable artifacts
- Have as little build configuration as possible
- Unified way to bundle javascript games using any framework
- Abstract away the build-tools (think of `parcel` for gamedevs)
- Allow to import assets and consume them directly through your preferred framework
- Optimize and compress assets
- Distribution targets: Web, Desktop Native, Mobile

## Non-goals:

- Be a game framework

## Potential integrations

- Minify and obfuscate shader code https://github.com/laurentlb/Shader_Minifier
- Generate bitmap fonts
